There are primarily 2 things you should know.

    If 2 threads call the same method, each thread will have a different Stack Frame for the method. So, method local variables are thread safe. The changes made in local variables of one method will not interfere with other thread's changes.

    You should (usually) worry about thread-safety / interference when you have a shared resource being modified by both threads.

PS : Your doSum() does very little processing. A smart JVM might actually inline the method.

All of your threads can call add at the same time without consequence.

This is because inside the method the number and num variables are local to that method only - and also to the caller thread. If number and/or num were global it would be a different story.
